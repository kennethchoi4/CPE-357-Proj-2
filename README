The goal of this assignment was to create a guessing game that would allow the program to guess the animal that the user was thinking of. 
The program will ask the user if their initial guess was correct and if it was incorrect, it will ask the user what the answer was and ask for 
a distinguishing detail between the answer and the previous guess. This way the program 'learns' from the incorrect answers.
